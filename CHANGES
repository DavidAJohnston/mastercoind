    shutdown
  - Fix an issue in the script handling for OP_CHECKSIG

  - Separate the debug profile http server from the RPC server
  - Rework of the RPC code to improve performance and make the code cleaner
  - The getrawtransaction RPC call now properly checks the memory pool
    before consulting the db (https://github.com/conformal/btcd/issues/26)
  - Add support for the following RPC calls: getpeerinfo, getconnectedcount,
    addnode, verifychain
    (https://github.com/conformal/btcd/issues/13)
    (https://github.com/conformal/btcd/issues/17)

    operating systems (https://github.com/conformal/btcd/issues/30)
  - Add a default redirect to the http profiling page when accessing the
    http profile server
  - Add a new --cpuprofile option which can be used to generate CPU
    profiling data on platforms that support it
  - Several other minor performance optimizations

Changes in 0.3.2 (Tue Oct 22 2013)
  - Fix an issue that could cause the download of the block chain to stall
    (https://github.com/conformal/btcd/issues/12)
  - Remove deprecated sqlite as an available database backend
  - Close sqlite compile issue as sqlite has now been removed
    (https://github.com/conformal/btcd/issues/11)
  - Change default RPC ports to 8334 (mainnet) and 18334 (testnet)
  - Continue cleanup and work on implementing RPC API calls
  - Add support for the following RPC calls: getrawmempool,
    getbestblockhash, decoderawtransaction, getdifficulty,
    getconnectioncount, getpeerinfo, and addnode
  - Improve the btcctl utility that is used to issue JSON-RPC commands
  - Fix an issue preventing btcd from cleanly shutting down with the RPC
    stop command
  - Add a number of database interface tests to ensure backends implement
    the expected interface
  - Expose some additional information from btcscript to be used for
    identifying "standard"" transactions
  - Add support for plan9 - thanks @mischief
    (https://github.com/conformal/btcd/pull/19)
  - Other minor bug fixes and general code cleanup

Changes in 0.3.1-alpha (Tue Oct 15 2013)
  - Change default database to leveldb
    NOTE: This does mean you will have to redownload the block chain.  Since we
    are still in alpha, we didn't feel writing a converter was worth the time as
    it would take away from more important issues at this stage
  - Add a warning if there are multiple block chain databases of different types
  - Fix issue with unexpected EOF in leveldb -- https://github.com/conformal/btcd/issues/18
  - Fix issue preventing block 21066 on testnet -- https://github.com/conformal/btcchain/issues/1
  - Fix issue preventing block 96464 on testnet -- https://github.com/conformal/btcscript/issues/1
  - Optimize transaction lookups
  - Correct a few cases of list removal that could result in improper cleanup
    of no longer needed orphans
  - Add functionality to increase ulimits on non-Windows platforms
  - Add support for mempool command which allows remote peers to query the
    transaction memory pool via the bitcoin protocol
  - Clean up logging a bit
  - Add a flag to disable checkpoints for developers
  - Add a lot of useful debug logging such as message summaries
  - Other minor bug fixes and general code cleanup

Initial Release 0.3.0-alpha (Sat Oct 05 2013):
  - Initial release
